# Model Fingerprint

## Introduction
A model-agnostic method to decompose predictions into linear, nonlinear and pairwise interaction effects.

Based on paper [Beyond the Black Box: An Intuitive Approach to Investment Prediction with Machine Learning](https://www.pm-research.com/content/iijjfds/2/1/61).

The resulting linear, nonlinear, and pairwise effects have the same units as response variable.
